# Travel App

This page was created as part of the final project of Udacity, where I used various technologies, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.Js, Express, WebPack, among others.
In order to develop this project, I connected my project with 3 Rest API, which provides me with information on various places, from latitude, longitude, weather forecast, images of each place, etc.

## Using the app

In order to use the application you must enter the city where you want to go. If the place is within the United States, you must enter the city, and the state to be able to have more precision in the search.
Then, the application is configured for all default searches of the sea in the United States, so if you want to go to any other country, it must be specified in the country of entry.
Then you must enter the date you want to travel and the return date, then click the Send button.
Our search will return us (if the site has been found), the destination where you are going, the date of the trip, the date of return, the number of days that the trip will last, the temperature of the site and a description of the weather from the destination.
